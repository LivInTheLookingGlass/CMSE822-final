\section{Introduction}

Hyperbolic PDEs are useful for various phyical phenomena.

Acoustics, electromagnetic, fluid motion, etc.

Linear vs non linear 

Advection equation

Burgers' equation

Use viscous Burgers' equaiton to remove limiters

Look at 2nd and 4th order using finite difference

\section{Methodology}

Investigate 2D Burgers' in c++ using OpenMP

Look at strong vs weak scaling, cache blocking 


\section{Future Work}

Investgate using Kokkos 

Stepping stone to k-athena
