\section{Introduction}

Hyperbolic PDEs are useful for various phyical phenomena.

Acoustics, electromagnetic, fluid motion, etc.

Linear vs non linear 

Advection equation

Burgers' equation

Use viscous Burgers' equaiton to not worrt about limiters

Look at 2nd and 4th order using finite difference

\section{Methodology}

Investigate 2D Burgers' in c++ using OpenMP

Look at strong and weak scaling, cache blocking 

strong and weak on CPU and GPU

look at how to configure/optimize omp for GPU

omp 4.5 and 5.0 have support for optimizing GPUs

\section{Future Work}

Investgate using Kokkos 

Stepping stone to k-athena
